 <h3>The Death of Stalin</h3>
 <p>An historically accurate but quickily funny movie about the transition from Stalin to his successors.</p>
 <h3>The Aviator</h3>
 <p>Fascinating and well-acted true story of Howard Hughes life.</p>
 <h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
 <p>Also largely true story of a man who is able to kite hundreds of checks by pretending to be, among other things, an airline pilot.</p>
